# What is this ?

This project is a game created as part of my studies.
It's a bomberman game (with a really bad IA) you can play alone.
In future version you will be able to play with a friend on the same keyboard (to replace the AI)

# What does it looks like

(here is the first map, there a 3 of them)

the assets are from MattSkala ([his repository](https://github.com/MattSkala/html5-bombergirl))

# What are the controls ?

The controls are the arrow keys or ZQSD for the player (here the girl)

# How does it works

You have to clone the repository first
```
git clone https://github.com/Hypario/Bomberman
```
then build it via `File > Build Settings`

DO NOT FORGET TO PUT THE SCENES ON THE SCENE BUILDER.

When it's done, you can select the platform you want, build and run it !
